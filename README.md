# Bounded Voronoi Demo

This repository contains sample data for the Mapsense Bounded Voronoi demo, as well as a python script (voronoi.py) and a Jupyter notebook (Voronoi.ipynb) which will create a bounded Voronoi diagram.

## Dependencies:
    numpy >= 1.9.2
    scipy >= 0.15.1
    shapely >= 1.4.1

## Installation:
